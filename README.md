  ## Description 
This is a back-end application designed to create a social networking platform where users can share thoughts, react to others' thoughts, and manage friend lists. Built with MongoDB for database storage and Express.js for handling server-side logic. Users can be added, deleted, or updated, while their thoughts, reactions, and friendships are dynamically stored in the database through various API routes.

Key Features:

User Management: Add, update, and delete users.
Thought Sharing: Post thoughts and allow reactions to those thoughts.
Friend Connections: Add and remove friends from user profiles.
MongoDB Integration: NoSQL database for scalable and flexible data storage.
Express.js Backend: Handles all server-side operations.
